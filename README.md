##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

The project employs rigorous data preprocessing to ensure data quality:

 **Missing Value Handling** – Strategic imputation and removal of incomplete records  
 **DateTime Conversion** – Standardizing date columns for temporal analysis  
 **Feature Extraction** – Creating new features (year_added, month_added, age_on_netflix)  
 **Multi-value Column Exploding** – Splitting genres, countries, and cast members  
 **Duration Normalization** – Standardizing duration formats across content types  
 **Duplicate Removal** – Ensuring data integrity and consistency

##  Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. Content Type Distribution
Comparative analysis of movies versus TV shows in Netflix's catalog, revealing the platform's strategic content mix.

### 2. Content Addition Trends
Time-series visualization showing Netflix's content growth trajectory, particularly after global expansion post-2015.

### 3. Genre Popularity Analysis
Ranked visualization of the top 15 genres, revealing what content drives Netflix's catalog diversity.

### 4. Duration & Season Patterns
- Movie runtime distributions across genres
- TV show season counts and episodic patterns

### 5. Geographic Content Production
Top 15 countries producing Netflix content, highlighting global production hubs.

### 6. Rating Distribution Analysis
Maturity rating prevalence, showing Netflix's audience targeting strategy (TV-MA, TV-14, PG-13, etc.).

### 7. Content Age Engineering
Novel feature showing the gap between content release and Netflix acquisition—a key business insight.

### 8. Genre-Duration Relationships
Box plot analysis revealing duration patterns across top-performing genres.

### 9. Descriptive Text Analysis
Word cloud visualization highlighting dominant themes and keywords in content descriptions.

### 10. Bigram (Two-word Phrase) Analysis
Co-occurrence patterns revealing thematic clusters ("young woman," "best friends," "high school").

### 11. Director Influence Analysis
Top directors by content volume, identifying key creative contributors and production partners.

##  Key Insights Discovered

###  Content Maturity Evolution
Netflix has strategically shifted toward mature content (TV-MA, TV-14), reflecting audience demand and competitive positioning. Family-oriented content remains proportionally lower, indicating targeted demographic strategy.

###  Acquisition Strategy Variance
- **Movies:** Acquired significantly after release, averaging 5-10 years post-launch
- **TV Shows:** Acquired closer to release, reflecting investment in original series and current content
- **Implication:** Netflix balances licensed library content with original productions

###  Production Timeline Revolution
Post-2015 expansion shows a marked diagonal trend toward same-year Netflix Originals, demonstrating shift from licensing to in-house production.

###  Thematic Patterns
Dominant word pairs ("young woman," "best friends," "high school") reveal Netflix's focus on relationship-driven, coming-of-age narratives targeting younger demographics.

###  Creator Concentration
Select directors (e.g., Raúl Campos, Marcus Raboy) appear frequently due to recurring series and comedy specials, indicating strategic creator partnerships.
